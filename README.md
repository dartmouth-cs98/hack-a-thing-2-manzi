# hack-a-thing-2-manzi-bakar
Here lies a hacked thing. By Manzi and Bakar


# Short description of what you attempted to build
Tried to make a cam scanner for scanning pdfs using react native

# Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
Manzi - interacting with camera and scanning functionality
Bakar - Routing and handling data flow


# What you learned
It is surprisingly difficult to use the document scanner libraries. Some of them are out of date, and most of them are very poorly documented. 


# How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?

This is a potential part of our project since our project is to create a class management tool and part of the functionality is the ability for students to 'PDF scan' their homework and submit it directly on the app


# What didnâ€™t work

We are yet to figure out how to use the document scanning libraries, we are now going to try and use the rectangle-scanner libraries and if that fails we will try the document or rectangle identifying SDKs.
